### Hi there, I'm Adrián Gosálvez from Alicante, Spain 👋

#### I'm software engineer 💻

#### I was shocked by technology since my first computer science lesson in 1998 🖥️

#### My first online website was uploaded in a free hosting of Lycos by me when I was 12, developed with MS Frontpage, code snippets of JS and pictures about my hobbies, but no friend could visit it because they had not computer at home for these years 😢

- 🔭 I’m currently working in Aunoa Software as a Tech Lead.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about IA, NestJS and Slim4 to rich my background a little bit more.
- 💬 Ask me about some sort of technology or problem you have
