### Hi there, I'm Adrián Gosálvez from Alicante, Spain 👋

#### I'm software engineer 💻

#### I was shocked by technology since my first computer science lesson in 1998 🖥️

#### My first website was uploaded in Lycos by me when I was 12, developed with MS Frontpage, but no friend could visit it because they had not computer at home 😢

- 🌱 I’m learning about best practices, IA, JS and Blockchain to rich my background.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about some sort of technology or problem you have
