### Hi there, I'm Adrián Gosálvez from Alicante, Spain. 👋

#### I'm a software engineer 💻

#### I was shocked by technology since my first computer science lesson in 1998 🖥️

#### My first website was uploaded to Lycos by myself when I was 12. It was developed with MS Frontpage, but unfortunately, none of my friends could visit it because they didn't have a computer at home. 😢

- 🌱 I’m learning about best practices, IA, JS and Blockchain to rich my background.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about some sort of technology or problem you have
